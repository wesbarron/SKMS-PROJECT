## Project Description
This Security Knowledge Management System is designed to centralize and manage all security-related information within a corporation. The goal is to create a platform that encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among company employees, making it easier for them to access and stay updated on security policies, procedures, best practices, and other relevant information.

The system includes a discussion forum where employees can ask questions and receive answers from designated Expert users. This allows for easy information exchange and helps ensure that the knowledge stored in the system remains accurate and up-to-date. 

The system currently has a user portal and and a basic discussion forum implemented.
The system has updated to include a place for employees to report concerns and a place to offer best case practices and/or security knowledge.
